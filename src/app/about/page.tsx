        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I generally go by the alias SyndieKat (or syndie, or kat, I do not mind either way) on the internet. I am a software developer, though working with mobile apps for my job. </p><br></br>
        <p> I do have a wide variety of hobbies that I cycle through from time to time. I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, listening to music, and going to conventions. I also enjoy learning new things in general. In particular, I have a huge interest with aviation, and I am hoping to obtain my PPL some day as well as transition to a career in air traffic control (or aviation in general).</p><br></br>
        <p> Creative wise, I enjoy creative writing (especially worldbuilding). A goal for this website is for part of it to become a kind of encylopedia for my worldbuilding project, as well as a place to post stories. I am also hoping to learn to make art as well as music, and share stuffs related to those in the future. </p>
